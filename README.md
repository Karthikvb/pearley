# pearley
Pearley is a *shiny* new implementation of the Earley parsing algorithm in Javascript.

# math.js
This demo shows how Pearley can parse math expressions with the +, -, *, and / operators, parentheses, and numbers of arbitrary length.

To run it, you must include [tokenizer.js](https://purmou.github.io/ParserGen/tokenize.js) from my ParserGen repo to tokenize the strings.
